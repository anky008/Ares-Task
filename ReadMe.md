# Strategy used to implement the concepts marked
Computer Vision Tasks for Ares
Since I didn't even knew basics of python so i had to go through it at w3.schools.
After completing the basics of python I read about the numpy library.
After that i went to official opencv tutorials at pyimagesearch.com and looked through all the concepts that were essential to complete the task.
Finally I had to see how to jupyter notebook as i had only practiced writing python in notepad and then running it from cmd.




# What you learnt in the process
As i said, since i didn't even had the basics of python language clear so i had to go through that.So i learnt the bascis of python.
I learrnt about the numpy library in python, why it was needed and its functions.Then i learnt about opencv library in python and the 
numerous amount of stuff which we can do on the images like aplying filters to an image,detecting edges in an image and so on.
So this task got me started with a new programming language and helped me learn about its powerful tools and applications to which i
am greatful and thankful to.
